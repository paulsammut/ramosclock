# Ramos Alarm Clock

The Ramos Alarm Clock was an alarm clock that forced people to get out of bed in
the morning by making it impossible to shut off the alarm from bed and simply
going back to sleep. It accomplished this by use of a "defuse panel" which was a
wireless keypad that the user would place somewhere far away from their
bedroom. Most users just put it in the bahtroom; more extreme users put in their
car. When the alarm went off, the user had to get out of bed, and walk to the
defuse panel and punch in a defuse code to turn off the alarm. This gave well
intentioned users that really wanted to get up early but just had a hard time
escaping the cozy gravitational field of their bed the push they needed to start
their day fresh and early (kinda like how mom woke you up during highschool).
